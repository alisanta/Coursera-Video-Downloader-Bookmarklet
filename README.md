The bookmarklet generates bash code that can be entered directly into the command line and will download the selected videos sequentially. The videos are organized in the following structure:

    1. Introduction - Why Model?/
       1. Why Model?.mp4
       2. Intelligent Citizens of the World.mp4
       ...
    2. Segregation and Peer Effects/

## Notes

<a name="why_github_pages"></a>*Why do I have to navigate to this project's [GitHub Page](http://christiangenco.github.com/Coursera-Video-Downloader-Bookmarklet) before installing the bookmark?*

The markdown renderer on [this project's repo page](https://github.com/christiangenco/Coursera-Video-Downloader-Bookmarklet) doesn't allow inline javascript, which is how the bookmark functions. GitHub pages allow this.
